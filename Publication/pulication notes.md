## Report - Highlights of the 2001 National Household Travel Sursey

The objective of this report is to answer the questions of who is traveling in the nation, and how, why, when and where they are traveling—both on a daily basis and on longer distance trips.Consequently, this report is divided into three main areas:

1.travel-related characteristics of households and individuals in the United States;

2.characteristics of daily trips taken in the nation;

3.characteristics of long-distance trips made domestically (and to other countries).

## Report - Summary of Travel Trends: 2001 National Household Travel Survey

This report highlights important travel trends in tabular and graphic format. Statistics are categorized by topic. The report begins with a summary of travel and demographic changes. Next, travel changes are examined from an individual household perspective, then from an individual person perspective. This report concludes with trip-making statistics of sub-populations such as women, households without vehicles, low-income households, and the elderly. No attempt is made in this report to present all of the data or to analyze and discuss the data in any depth. Standard error estimates for key statistics are presented in Appendix 4.

## Report - Our Nation's Travel: Current Issues
This booklet highlights transportation issues as they relate to the daily travel of the American public. The 2001 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) is the primary source of statistical data for this exploration, although other sources are used and cited. The NHTS contains data on all trips: (1) of all lengths; (2) by all modes, and (3) for all purposes.

## Report - Transferring 2001 National Household Travel Survey

The method which can integrates the NHTS data and other data to estimate key travel characteristics for small geographic areas such as Census tract and transportation analysis zone.

## Report - Public Transit in America: Results from the 2001 National Household Travel Survey 

This document updates the popular report titled: “Public Transit in America - Evidence from the 1995 National Personal Transportation Survey” with data from the 2001 National Household Travel Survey. This new data provides a unique opportunity to develop a richer understanding of travel behavior and provide a resource to the industry in terms of specific analyses relevant to public transit. It characterizes public transit as it is today from a number of perspectives that are 
believed to be useful to planners and policy makers and it provides trend data for several critical variables that are important to public transportation.

This analysis describes transit travel, users, and markets. Topics analyzed include: trends in demographics, vehicle ownership, and personal travel between 1969 and 2001, transit mode share trends, extent of transferring, trip characteristics, and market penetration. Results are presented in descriptive terms with the authors providing observations and interpretation relevant for a better understanding of transit market shares and transit sub-markets.

The report concludes by outlining the challenges and opportunities for transit in light of revealed information about by whom and how transit is being used.

## Report - Socioeconomics of Urban Travel: Evidence from the 2001 NHTS 

The 2001 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) confirms most of the same travel trends and variations among socioeconomic groups documented by its predecessors, the Nationwide Personal Transportation Surveys (NPTS) of 1969, 1977, 1983, 1990, and 1995. The private car continues to dominate urban travel among every segment of the American population, including the poor, minorities, and the elderly. By comparison, public transport accounts for less than 2% of all urban travel. Even the lowest-income households make only 5% of their trips by transit. The most important difference in the 2001 NHTS is the doubling in modal share of walk trips in cities, due to a much improved survey technique that captured previously unreported walks. 

While the private car dominates travel, there are important variations in auto ownership and travel behavior by income, race, ethnicity, sex, and age. Overall, the poor, racial and ethnic minorities, and the elderly have much lower mobility rates than the general population. Moreover, the poor, blacks, and Hispanics are far more likely to use transit than other groups. Indeed, minorities and low-income households account for 63% of the nation’s transit riders. Different socioeconomic groups also have different rates of carpooling, tax use, bicycling, and walking. In addition, they travel different distances and at different times of day. Many of these socioeconomic variations in travel behavior have important consequences for public policy. 

## Conference - Data for Understanding Our Nation's Travel: National Household Travel Survey Conference: November 1-2, 2004

The effort to bring together a diverse set of data users was intended to develop a community of users who would better understand the utility and analytic capability of the data and subsequently provide feedback to inform the design of future national travel behavior surveys. This conference offered a unique opportunity for transportation professionals at the federal, state, and local levels, as well as for academics and other transportation researchers to 
• Discuss results of NHTS-based investigations of critical areas for transportation policy, 
• Learn about innovative applications of the data to understand and estimate travel behavior, 
• Provide input on the design of future national household travel surveys, 
• Identify emerging trends and data needs that should be reflected in future survey efforts, and 
• Discover data sources that complement the NHTS data in providing a more complete picture of travel behavior in the United States.
